# Example data for neural calcium imaging

The file `example_data_glm.pkl` contains neural activity of 100 neurons recorded from mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) using two-photon calcium imaging together with the related task and behavioral variables during a navigation-based decision-making task (Tseng et al. 2022). See the notebook `Tutorial_for_fitting_neural_calcium_imaging_data_with_GLM.ipynb` in the [tutorial](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/tutorial) folder for more details.
