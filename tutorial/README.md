# Tutorials for using GLM class and fitting neural data with GLM

The notebook `Tutorial_for_using_GLM_class.ipynb` contains the tutorial for fitting generalized linear models (GLM) using GLM and GLM_CV class. You can find the code script `glm_class.py` in the [code](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/code) folder.


The notebook `Tutorial_for_fitting_neural_calcium_imaging_data_with_GLM.ipynb` contains the tutorial for fitting generalized linear models (GLM) on real calcium imaging data recorded from a mouse performing a decision-making task in virtual maze. You can find the code script `glm_class.py` in the [code](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/code) folder, and the data file `example_data_glm.pkl` in the [data](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/data) folder.

It is recommended to download the tutorials, code and data, and try them out in Google Colaboratory with GPU runtime first, so you don't need to worry about configuring an environment at the beginning.
