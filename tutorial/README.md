# Tutorials for using GLM class and fitting neural data with GLM

The notebook `Tutorial_for_using_GLM_class.ipynb` contains the tutorial for fitting generalized linear models (GLM) using GLM and GLM_CV class. You can find the code script `glm_class.py` in the [code](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/code) folder.


The notebook `Tutorial_for_fitting_neural_calcium_imaging_data_with_GLM.ipynb` contains the tutorial for fitting generalized linear models (GLM) on real calcium imaging data recorded from a mouse performing a decision-making task in virtual maze. You can find the code script `glm_class.py` in the [code](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/code) folder, and the data file `example_data_glm.pkl` in the [data](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/data) folder.
