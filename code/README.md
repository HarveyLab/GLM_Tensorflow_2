# Code for GLM class
The Python script `glm_class.py` contains GLM class definitions and utility functions for fitting GLM in Tensorflow 2. See the notebook `Tutorial_for_using_GLM_class.ipynb` in the [tutorial](https://github.com/sytseng/GLM_Tensorflow_2/tree/main/tutorial) folder for the guide for using this code.

## Quick start
Load the code as a module 
```
import glm_class as glm
```
